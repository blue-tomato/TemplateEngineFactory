# Template Engine Factory

A module integrating template engines such as Twig into ProcessWire. It allows to render pages or individual templates
via template engine and encourages to separate logic from markup by implementing a simple _MVC_ pattern. 

* For a quick introduction, please read the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section of this readme.
* More information is available in the official [Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

> Version `2.x` of this module differs from the `1.x` version in many ways. Modules providing template engines must now be
installed with composer only. Twig is currently the only template engine implemented for the `2.x` major version. Please
take a look at the [upgrade guide](), as the new version introduces several backwards compatibility breaks.

## Requirements

* ProcessWire 3.0 or newer
* PHP 7.0 or newer
* Composer

## Installation

Execute the following command in the root directory of your ProcessWire installation:  

```
composer require wanze/template-engine-factory:^2.0 --no-dev
```

This will automatically install the module in the `site/modules` directory.

**Installing a template engine**

Each template engine is installed with a separate ProcessWire module. If you would like to use [Twig](https://github.com/wanze/TemplateEngineTwig),
you may execute the following command instead:

```
composer require wanze/template-engine-twig:^2.0 --no-dev
```

This will install the _Template Engine Twig_ module and the _Template Engine Factory_ module in one step.

After the installation, make sure to enable the _Template Engine Factory_ module and also the module providing a template
engine in the ProcessWire backend. 

> The `--no-dev` flag tells Composer to not install develop dependencies used for the tests being part of this repository.
If you are interested to execute the tests, require the module without this flag.

## Configuration

The module offers the following configuration options:

* **`Template Engine`** The template engine used to render pages and templates. Any installed engine is listed here.
* **`Path to templates`** Relative path from the site directory where template files are stored. E.g. `templates/views/`
resolves to `/site/templates/views/`.
* **`Enable automatic page rendering`** Check to delegate the rendering of pages to the template engine.
You may enable or disable this behaviour for specific templates.
* **`API variable to interact with the template engine`** Enter a name for the API variable used to pass data from
the ProcessWire template (Controller) to the template engine.
* **`Enabled templates`** Restrict automatic page rendering to the templates selected here.
* **`Disabled templates`** Select templates of pages that should not automatically be rendered via template engine.
Do not use in combination with the _Enabled templates_ configuration,
either enable or disable templates.

> More configuration options might be available in the module providing a template engine, e.g. the
module _TemplateEngineTwig_ offers several configuration related to Twig.

## Available Template Engines

* **ProcessWire** A template engine using ProcessWire's *TemplateFile* class for rendering. This engine ships with this module, but it is not installed automatically. Install
the module _Template Engine ProcessWire_ and select the engine in the _Template Engine Factory_ module configuration.
* **Twig** See: https://github.com/wanze/TemplateEngineTwig

## Getting Started

> This section assumes that Twig is used as active template engine, but the usage is excatly the same for any other template
engine.

### Using the Template Engine to render templates

Assume the following Twig template exists in `/site/templates/views/foo.html.twig`

```twig
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
{% if body %}
    <p>{{ body }}</p>
{% endif %}
```

The template can be rendered anywhere with the _Template Engine Factory_ module:

```php
$factory = wire('modules')->get('TemplateEngineFactory');
$factory->render('foo', ['title' => 'Foo', 'body' => 'Hello World']);
```

### Automatic Page Rendering

If enabled, this feature uses the template engine to render ProcessWire pages when calling the `Page::render` method.
By default, the module tries to find a Twig template matching the same name as the ProcessWire template:

* `/site/templates/views/home.html.twig` corresponds to `/site/templates/home.php`
* `/site/templates/views/about.html.twig` corresponds to `/site/templates/about.php`

ProcessWire templates have access to a `$view` API variable which can be used to pass data to the template engine.
As the template engine is now responsible to output markup, ProcessWire templates can be seen as _Controllers_.
They process the request and pass data to the _View_ layer via the `$view` API variable.

**Examples**

Consider the following ProcessWire template in `/site/templates/home.php`

```php
// Form has been submitted, do some processing, send mail, save data... 
if ($input->post->form) {
  // ...
  $session->redirect('./');
}

// Forward some data to twig
$view->set('nav_items', $pages->get('/')->children());
```

The corresponding Twig template in `/site/templates/views/home.html.twig` might look like this:

```twig
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<ul class="nav">
{% for item in nav_items %}
    <li><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<form name="form">
    <input type="text" name="email">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Note that the ProcessWire template does not echo out any markup. It just contains business logic and uses the `$view` API
variable to pass data to the Twig template. That's it! The most simple _MVC_ pattern available in ProcessWire ðŸ˜Ž
